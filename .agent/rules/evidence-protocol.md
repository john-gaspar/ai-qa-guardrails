# Evidence Protocol

- Capture prompt, raw AI output, and human edits in `examples/` per scenario.
- Save test artifacts: command outputs for lint/type/tests, contract checks, and screenshots/logs with secrets redacted.
- Link evidence in PRs using `CHECKLISTS/ai-usage-checklist.md` and `EVALS/evaluation-playbook.md`.
- Note assumptions, gaps, and follow-ups; tie to issue IDs.
- Keep evidence small and sanitized; avoid storing binaries unless necessary.
