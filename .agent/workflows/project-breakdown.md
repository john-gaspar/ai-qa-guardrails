# Workflow: Project Breakdown

1) Collect requirements/epics; identify external dependencies and contracts.
2) Slice work by feature/endpoint and risk; create issues in `docs/planning/issue-map.md`.
3) For each slice, draft plan/test cases using `PROMPTS/10-test-plan.md` and `20-test-cases.md`.
4) Assign owners and timelines; mark prerequisites (env, mocks, data).
5) Define evidence paths in `examples/` per slice; set acceptance criteria per `CHECKLISTS/qa-automation-definition-of-done.md`.
6) Track progress with lightweight status and link ADRs/PRs.
