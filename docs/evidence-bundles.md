# Evidence Bundles

What to attach to PRs and reviews:
- Prompt + raw AI output + human edits for the change (`examples/...`).
- Test artifacts: lint/type/test command outputs; contract validation results; sanitized logs/screens.
- Traceability: link test cases to requirements/contracts and risk level (per `docs/risk-rubric.md`).
- Assumptions and gaps with owners/follow-ups.
- ADR links if decisions were made.
